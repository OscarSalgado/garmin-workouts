description: 'Let''s be honest: Sometimes even the best workout seems to leave you
  wanting more-especially when it comes to your abs. If you ever feel like you need
  a little more focus on your core and a few more calories burned, then this plan
  is for you. This is what you call an "Abs Finisher" and it''s specifically designed
  to push you to your goal without accepting failure. By plugging in these challenging
  and unique abs finishers after your main workout and into your success plan, you
  find yourself leaner in less time.'
