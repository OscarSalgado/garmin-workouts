description: 'After a five-minute dynamic warmup, complete the following workout:
  40 seconds of intense work, where you try and get as many reps of each exercise,
  followed by 20 seconds of rest. Do this 40/20 for 10 minutes followed by stretching
  for a cool down. For an additional challenge, try burpees instead of squat thrusts.'
