description: 'Complete a Gran Fondo today.

  The pace should be comfortable (5-6 on a 10 scale) and you should be in your Endurance
  Miles Power and HR range.

  Nutrition and hydration will be crucial to having a positive experience today.

  Your goal should be to finish the ride within 2% of your pre-ride bodyweight.

  Losing more than about 2% of your bodyweight due to dehydration can significantly
  hinder your performance, and larger water losses can be dangerous.

  During the ride, consume at least 1 bottle of sports drink or one bottle of water
  each hour.

  To properly fuel your ride, consume 30-60 grams of carbohydrate per hour of riding.'
