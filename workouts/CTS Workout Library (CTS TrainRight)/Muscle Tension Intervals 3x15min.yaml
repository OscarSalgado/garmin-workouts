description: 'Muscle Tensions are to be performed within your Tempo Zone, with a focus
  on high force/torque, and low cadence pedaling durations.

  This type of workout can enhance the recruitment of fast-twitch muscle fibers for
  high intensity efforts and result in better pedaling mechanics by increasing the
  attention paid to individual regions of the pedal stroke.
