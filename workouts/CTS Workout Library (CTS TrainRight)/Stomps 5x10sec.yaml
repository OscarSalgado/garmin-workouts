description: 'Stomps are specificity-based sprint workouts that should be performed
  as short, maximum efforts within your Anaerobic Capacity Zone.

  Begin each interval  at a moderate speed in one of your hardest gears.

  You should stay in the saddle during Stomps, accelerating at the start of the interval
  by stomping hard on the pedals.

  Stomps will help to develop and enhance correct muscle recruitment patterns throughout
  the pedal stroke.'
