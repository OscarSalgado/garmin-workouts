description: 'Hill Acceleration intervals consist of two parts.

  The first part of the interval is to be ridden within your Threshold Zone, at Climbing
  Repeat power.

  Once you reach the last 30-60 seconds of the interval, you accelerate into your
  VO2max zone, holding a Power Interval intensity until the end of the interval.

  Hill Accelerations are specificity workouts that help to develop the acceleration
  required to push over the top of climbs while already at a high pace in a race,
  group-ride, or event.
