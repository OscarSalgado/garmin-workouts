description: 'Power Starts are specificity-based sprint workouts that should be performed
  as short, maximum efforts within your Anaerobic Capacity Zone.

  Power Starts should begin at a very low speed, nearly a standstill, in one of your
  hardest gears.

  By jumping hard out of the saddle to reach peak speed as quickly as possible, Power
  Starts will help develop and enhance correct muscle recruitment patterns throughout
  the pedal stroke.
