description: 'Speed Intervals should be performed within your VO2max Zone.

  Speed Intervals work to increase VO2max, resulting in your body being able to take
  in and utilize more oxygen to fuel your efforts.

  Speed Intervals also have a specificity focus that can be applied to developing
  better repeatability, lactate buffering, and acceleration for short burst efforts
  during events like criteriums, MTB races, and cyclocross races.
