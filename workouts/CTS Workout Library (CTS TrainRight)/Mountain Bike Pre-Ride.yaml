description: 'Pre-ride the race course today.

  The purpose of pre-riding courses is to scout out the best lines through technical
  terrain and the best places to either launch attacks or recover from hard efforts.

  The intensity of this ride should be mostly aerobic, but it''s a good idea to ride
  a few sections, especially the technical areas, at near race-pace.'
