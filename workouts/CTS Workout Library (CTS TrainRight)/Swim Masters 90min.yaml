  United States Masters Swimming (USMS) is a national organization that provides organized
  workouts, competitions, clinics and workshops for adults aged 18 and over.

  Programs are open to all adult swimmers (fitness, triathletes, competitive, non-competitive)
  who are dedicated to improving their fitness through swimming.

  Within the clubs, structured workouts, often with a coach, offer well-thought-out
  training assistance.

  USMS programs also offer stroke and technique clinics, workshops, and instruction,
  as well as social functions.

  All USMS programs are designed to help swimmers improve fitness and/or train for
  specific goals, and offer active support for a healthy lifestyle through friendship,
  and camaraderie.'
