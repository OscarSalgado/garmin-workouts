description: Pretty much every woman wants tight, toned abs. We've known that for
  a long time. But what most women don't know is that they already have them! They're
  just hidden under a thin layer of fat. To reveal your defined midsection, you may
  need to change your definition of an "abs workout." This routine is about condensing
  what you'd normally do in an hour into 10 minutes. The result is an intense plan
  that actually melts fat.
