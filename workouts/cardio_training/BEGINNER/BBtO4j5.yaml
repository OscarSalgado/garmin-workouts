description: The Tabata Protocol is a four-minute, high intensity workout where you
  perform as many reps as possible during a 20 second work period, followed by 10
  seconds of rest, repeated 8 times.For this beginner Tabata, you will perform four
  alternating exercises in sequence and then repeat for a total of 4 minutes of work.As
  you get familiar with Tabata workouts, begin by pacing yourself to ensure you get
  through the workout successfully. Try to add to your total number of reps each time
  you do the workout.The Tabata protocol, developed by Dr. Izumi Tabata, consists
  of alternating short periods of intense exercise with short periods of rest for
  a period of 4 minutes. The Tabata protocol can be applied to a variety of exercises
  including lifting weights and aerobic exercises.
