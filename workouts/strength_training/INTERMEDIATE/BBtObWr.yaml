description: 'Sometimes it''s best to follow the KISS method: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
  And when in the gym-a place with machines and endless equipment-a KISS mentality
  can go a long way to simplify your approach to the body you want. That''s the design
  of this workout. It sticks to just dumbbells to give your body exactly what it needs
  without all the confusion.'
