description: No matter how much your health and wellness are the primary reasons you
  exercise, there's something to be said about vanity. Looking good feels good. Problem
  is, most people can only talk about looking good rather than actually show it off.
  This summer, don't settle for something less than what you want. This program will
  have you looking great at the beach, at barbecues, or in your bedroom. This is the
  summer of abs.
