description: 'Every guy had a time in his life when he looked and felt his best. Whether
  it was high

  school, college, or just a few years ago, you probably peaked at some point in your
  life, and now that body you had seems like it belonged to someone else. But there''s
  no need to reminisce. After all, your body only needs a new stimulus to help you
  shed the excess weight you''ve added and shock your muscles into new growth-and
  in doing so you can surpass your peak performance something of the future and not
  the past.'
