In my case it’s about 49s per 50 \n Rest is not less than 5 seconds, not more than 10 seconds, in my case… 12x50 leave on 55s and I’ll come in on 49, or so \n If you don’t know how to use a pace clock, or don’t have one, then simply take 2 slow, deep breaths between 50s"

    - description: "3x100 \n Take the pace from the 2nd 300 (last week) and see if you can hit it three times in a row. If you double the send off from your 50, and subtract 5s, then that should give you 5-10s rest, in my case… 55+55-5 is 1:45 send off and I’ll come in 1:36, or so. Same deal if you’re swimming on feel… two slow, deep breaths between swims"
