content: Rest day. How comfortable are you on the bike? Many people spend thousands
  on buying a bike but then never get it fitted properly. However, it's a worthwhile
  investment. Not only will it help you to be more comfortable and efficient on the
  bike, it will also help your running because you won't get off the bike as fatigued.
