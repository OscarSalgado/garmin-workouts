content: Ideally take the day off here but you can move this day off to another day
  in the week if it fits your schedule better, but try not to do back to back hard
  sessions if you can avoid it. Work on your nutrition especially your recovery after
  a hard or long session where you need to take in both carbs and protein within 30
  minutes of finishing.
