content: Race Day! Good Luck! Get there with plenty of time to spare so you're not
  rushed and stressed. Use your Garmin as a guide through the event, but race on feel
  as well as what it is telling you. HR can often be higher than normal due to adrenaline.
  Aim to even or negative split through each leg, just like you have practiced in
  training. Most of all enjoy yourself!
