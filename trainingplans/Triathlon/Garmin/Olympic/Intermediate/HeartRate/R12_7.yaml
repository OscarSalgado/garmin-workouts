content: Race Day! Good Luck! Get there with plenty of time to spare, so you're not
  rushed or stressed. Use your Garmin device as your guide during the event, but also
  listen to your body. HR can often be higher than normal due to adrenaline. Aim for
  even or negative splits as you progress, just like you practiced in training. Most
  of all, enjoy yourself!
