description: '90 Minute Workout

  - Warm up.

  - Ride 5 minutes, with a cadence at 60 RPM, in the high end of zone 3 or low end
  of zone 4. 2 minutes rest. Repeat 4 times.

  - Ride approximately 30 minutes to complete the 90 Minute Workout.

  - Cool down.


  This workout can be really effective at boosting your strength on the bike. It''s
  not the same as doing strength training in the gym, but it is good at recruiting
  the muscle fibers that aren''t normally recruited to help when you''re riding at
  higher cadences.'
