description: '60 Minute Workout

  - Warm up.

  - Ride 10 minutes at tempo, 3 minutes recovery pace in zone 2. Repeat 2 times.

  - Finish the hour in zone 2 for 10-15 minutes.


  This is a great workout to start working on your threshold. If you''re not used
  to these sustained efforts, you''ll build the capacity to hold this intensity. As
  you get better, you''ll be able to reduce recovery time between the reps, and work
  toward longer and longer intervals at this intensity.'
