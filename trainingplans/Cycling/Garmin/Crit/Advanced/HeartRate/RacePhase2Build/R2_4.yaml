description: '90 Minute Workout

  - Warm up.

  - Ride 30 seconds hard, 10 minutes at threshold.

  Repeat 3 times.

  - 8 minute recovery ride in zone 1 or 2.

  - Ride 10-15 minutes in zone 2.

  The main goal of this workout is to get used to holding a steady pace after a 30
  second sprint.

  Think of it like a big surge for 30 seconds, followed by a sustained 10 minute attack
  to get away from the group you''ve just left in your dust.'
