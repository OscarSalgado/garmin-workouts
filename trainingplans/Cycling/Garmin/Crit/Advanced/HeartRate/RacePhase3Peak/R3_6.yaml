description: '90 Minute Workout

  - Quick warm up.

  - Ride 15 minutes at threshold.

  Rest as much as needed.

  Repeat 3 times.

  If your event has a lot of climbing, these intervals should be on a hill.

  Let the road you find (uphill or flat) dictate the amount of rest you take between
  intervals.
