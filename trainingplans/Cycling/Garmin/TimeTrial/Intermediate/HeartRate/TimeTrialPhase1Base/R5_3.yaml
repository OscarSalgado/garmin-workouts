description: '60 Minute Workout

  - Warm up.

  - Ride 3 minutes hard in the high end of zone 5. Your heart rate won''t reach that
  level until the end of the interval. If you don''t have a power meter, you will
  have to estimate the effort.

  - Ride 10 minutes hard at the high end of zone 4 or low end of zone 5.

  - Cool down.


  These intervals should be hard, but you shouldn''t have trouble finishing them.'
