description: '60 Minute Race Simulation

  - Race warm up.

  - Ride 30 minutes at race pace.



  This workout should be done on a course that replicates the time trial course as
  closely as possible.

  Perform this workout in the position you intend to race your time trial.

  Focus on that position, especially as you fatigue toward the end of the 30 minutes.

  This is as an opportunity to test your race prep routine.'
