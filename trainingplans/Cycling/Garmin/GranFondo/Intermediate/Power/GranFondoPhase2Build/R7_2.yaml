description: "- Warm up.\n- Ride 30 seconds at all-out effort. Repeat 3-5 times. 8\
  \ minutes rest.\n- Cool down.\n\nThis type of workout is really effective at boosting\
  \ your anaerobic capacity and VO2 max. Each repetition should be all-out effort.\
  \ Sprint as hard as you can, and if you can barely turn the pedals at the end, you're\
  \ doing it right! \n\nIf you haven't done these before, start with 3 reps and see\
  \ how you feel before trying to do 5 reps. "
