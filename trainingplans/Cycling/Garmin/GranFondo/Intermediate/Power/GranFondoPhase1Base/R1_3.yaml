  Try this workout before you do a proper fitness signature test. The goal is to do
  an effort that''s almost as long as the test effort, but short enough so that you''re
  not exhausted by the end. After you''ve done this workout, you''ll have a much better
  starting point for the fitness signature test workouts.'
