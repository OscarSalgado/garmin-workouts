description: '60 Minute Workout

  - Quick warm up.

  - Ride 10 minutes at threshold. 5 minutes rest. Repeat 3 times.

  - Cool down.


  This is a great workout to start working on your threshold. If you''re not used
  to these sustained efforts, you''ll build the capacity to hold this intensity. As
  you get better, you''ll be able to reduce recovery time between the reps, and work
  toward longer and longer intervals at this intensity.'
