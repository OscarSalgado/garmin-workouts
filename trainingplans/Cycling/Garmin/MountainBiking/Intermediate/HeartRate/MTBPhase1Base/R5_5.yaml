description: '60 Minute Workout

  - Warm up.

  - Ride 15-20 minutes hard in zone 4.

  - Ride 15 minutes in zone 2.

  - Cool down.


  It might take one or two workouts to dial in the effort you need to complete 20
  minutes at this intensity.

  Start conservative, and build up from there so you''re holding a high heart rate
  and power for the whole 20 minutes.'
