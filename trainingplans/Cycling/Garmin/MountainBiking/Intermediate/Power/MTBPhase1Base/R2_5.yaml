description: '- Full warm up.

  - 20 minute time trial.

  - 10 minute recovery ride in zone 1 or 2.

  - Cool down.


  Try to keep the time trial paced as evenly as possible, but it should be at maximum
  effort.


  This is one of the workouts you should try to do near the beginning of each training
  block when you''re relatively well rested.

  Don''t worry if you''re a little tired going into this test; you can still learn
  a lot about how training and recovery combine to produce a given performance, even
  if you''re not at your best.'
