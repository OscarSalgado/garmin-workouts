description: '- Full warm up.

  - 3 minute time trial.

  - 20 minute recovery ride in zone 1 or 2.

  - 10 minute time trial.

  - Cool down.


  Try to keep the time trials paced as evenly as possible, but they should be at maximum
  effort.


  This is one of the workouts you should try to do near the beginning of each training
  block when you''re relatively well rested. Don''t worry if you''re a little tired
  going into this test; you can still learn a lot about how training and recovery
  combine to produce a given performance, even if you''re not at your best.'
