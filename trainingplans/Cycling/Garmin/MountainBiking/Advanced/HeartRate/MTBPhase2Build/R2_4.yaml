description: "90 Minute Workout \n- Warm up.\n- Ride 30 seconds hard, 10 minutes at\
  \ threshold. Repeat 3 times.\n- 8 minute recovery ride in zone 1 or 2.\n- Ride 10-15\
  \ minutes in zone 2.\n\nUse a mountain bike, if possible. The main goal of this\
  \ workout is to get used to holding a steady pace after a 30 second \"attack.\"\
  \ Think of it like a big surge for 30 seconds, followed by a sustained 10 minute\
  \ attack to get away from the group you've just left in your dust."
